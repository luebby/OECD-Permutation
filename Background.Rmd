### Data

OECD Regional Well-Being data (2019) is used here. The data shows how regions perform when it comes to education, environment, safety and other topics important to your well-being. This interactive site allows you to measure well-being in your region and compare it with 402 other OECD regions based on eleven topics central to the quality of our lives.

Source: [https://www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org/](https://www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org/)

-  Labour force with at least secondary education (in \%): `Labour`
-  Employment rate (in \%): `Employment`
-  Unemployment rate (in \%): `Unemployment`
-  Household disposable income per capita (in constant USD PPP): `Household`
-  Homicide rate (per 100000 people): `Homicide`
-  Mortality rate (per 100000 people): `Mortality`
-  Life expectancy (in number of years): `Life`
-  Air pollution (level of PM2.5, in $\mu g/ m^3$): `Air`
-  Voter turnout (in \%): `Voter`
-  Broadband access (in \% of households): `Broadband`
-  Number of rooms per person (rooms per person): `Number`
-  Perceived social network support (in \%): `Perceived`
-  Self assessment of life satisfaction (index 0 to 10): `Self`


### Observed Difference

For the countries `Poland` and `Germany` and the variable `Labour` (Labour force with at least secondary education (in \%)) it turns out that

- $\bar{x}_{\text{Germany}} = `r round(mean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data)[1],2)`$
- $\bar{x}_{\text{Poland}} = `r round(mean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data)[2],2)`$

So that 

$$\bar{x}_{\text{Poland}} - \bar{x}_{\text{Germany}} = `r round(mean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data)[2],2)` - `r round(mean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data)[1],2)` = `r round(diffmean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data),2)`$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}
p1 <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = Country, y = Labour, color = Country)) +
      geom_point() +
      stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", aes(colour = Country), size = 1.5, alpha = 0.5) +
      labs(title = paste("Observed difference in means:", Obs_Diff),
           y="Labour")
p1
```

### Permuted differences plot

But what if the distribution of the data generating process would be the same for both countries, formally: $F(x)_{\text{Germany}}=F(x)_{\text{Poland}}$? If this hypothetical model is true than the oberservations can be shuffled, i.e. permuted. If the value for `Labour` is identical distributed for both countries (`Germany` and `Poland`) than it does not matter if an observation comes from Poland or Germany. Identical distribution also leads to:

$$H_0: \mu_{\text{Germany}}=\mu_{\text{Poland}} \Leftrightarrow \mu_{\text{Poland}}- \mu_{\text{Germany}}=0$$

Considering randomness, statistical hypothesis test ask: if the null hypothesis (here: no difference) would be true, what is the probability of an at least as extreme difference as the one in the observed sample?

We can simulate data according to the model $F(x)_{\text{Germany}}=F(x)_{\text{Poland}}$ by random permutation of the country:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
p <- ggplot(shuffled_data, aes(x = Shuffled_Country, y = Labour, color = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", aes(colour = Shuffled_Country), size = 1.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Shuffle: {closest_state}") +
  transition_states(Shuffle)
anim_save("permutation.gif", animate(p))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("permutation.gif")
```

The next figure shows the differences after permutation for each shuffle:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}
ggplot(Shuffled_Diffs, aes(x = Shuffle, y = Diff_Mean, color = abs(Diff_Mean) >= abs(Obs_Diff))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = abs(Obs_Diff)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -abs(Obs_Diff)) +
  labs(title = paste("Number of permutations with larger difference in means \n than observed:",
                     sum(abs(Shuffled_Diffs$Diff_Mean) >= abs(Obs_Diff)),
                     "\n for countries ", my_countries[1], "and ", my_countries[2]),
       subtitle = paste("Observed difference in means:", Obs_Diff),
       y = paste("Difference in means of Variable:\n ", my_variable)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The permutated differences $\bar{x}^*_{\text{Poland}} - \bar{x}^*_{\text{Germany}}$ are in the range of $\pm 4$ and never reach the observed difference of $`r round(diffmean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data),2)`$.

### Permutation Distribution

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}
ggplot(Shuffled_Diffs, aes(x = Diff_Mean, fill = abs(Diff_Mean) >= abs(Obs_Diff))) +
  geom_histogram(center=0, bins=21) +
  geom_rug() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = Obs_Diff) +
  labs(title = paste("Number of permutations with larger difference in means \n than observed:",
                     sum(abs(Shuffled_Diffs$Diff_Mean) >= abs(Obs_Diff)), " of ", nperm,
                     "\n for countries ",  my_countries[1], "and ",  my_countries[2]),
       x = paste("Difference in means of Variable:\n ", my_variable)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The histogram of the permutation distributions shows again that in this case it is very unlikely that, if $H_0$ would be true, we observe a difference of $`r round(diffmean(Labour ~ Country, data = my_data),2)`$ in a sample as we did. This leads to a rejection of $H_0$ as the data we have is not compatible to the model (no difference in distribution) that we hypothetically assumed.
